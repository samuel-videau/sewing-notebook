## Abstract

We are creating a sewing stash manager to follow the quantity of sewing supplies while doing projects. Some supplies will be for personnal use only, while other supplies may be shared between several users.

## Features

### Stock Management

- Create an entry for a specific sewing supply
- Edit the quantity of a supply to follow the availabilities
- Grant access to supply to users

### Project Management

- Create a project with a supply list
- Create a dynamic todo (consume supply depending on actions)
